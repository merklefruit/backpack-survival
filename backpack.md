# Week 1 Puzzle: Backpack Survival

> Team: Nicolas Racchi, Manuel Nava

## Problem statement

_In a long and dangerous hiking, you have to select items to bring with you in your backpack._

<div align="center" style="padding: 25px"><img src="backpack.png" height="400"></div>

The backpack has a capacity of **25kg**, you must select **one item per category** and you must not overcome the total capacity.

The goal is to maximize the survival points.

## Our Solution

We implemented our solution with a Python script, which can be found both in the same folder as this PDF and on GitHub: [https://www.github.com/nicolas-racchi/backpack-survival](https://www.github.com/nicolas-racchi/backpack-survival).

### Requirements & Installation

We used the `ortools` [library](https://developers.google.com/optimization) made by Google. In particular, this library provides access to many different kinds of optimization solvers, such as [GLOP](https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/glop) (Google's linear programming system), [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org) (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) and more â€” with an easy to use and well documented python wrapper.

To run our solution, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolas-racchi/backpack-survival.git
cd backpack-survival

# for Unix (optional)
virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate

pip i -r requirements.txt
python backpack.py
```

7. Final numbers

#### 1. Data model

We created items with arrays defining their properties, disregarding their category. In this case we have 4 different categories with 3 items each, so a total of 12 different items.

```python
data = {}
data['points'] = [10, 20, 25, 10, 20, 25, 5, 15, 20, 5, 15, 20]
data['weights'] = [5, 8, 12, 3, 5, 8, 5, 8, 12, 1, 2, 3]
data['capacity'] = 25
data['items'] = list(range(len(data['weights'])))
data['items_per_category'] = 3
```

#### 2. Choosing the right solver

This was a shot in the dark, because we don't have any knowledge of the theory behind these solvers (yet). We found a [similar problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/bin/multiple_knapsack) to use as a starting point. Google's documentation labels this kind of problem as [Packing](https://developers.google.com/optimization/bin/bin) and suggests the use of a mixed integer programming solver, so that's why we used the SCIP solver.

```python
solver = pywraplp.Solver.CreateSolver('SCIP')
```

#### 3. Declaring the variables

Since this is an integer problem, the variables are all integers. We created an object `x` with boolean values, so that `x[1] = 1` if the item has been put in the backpack, `0` otherwise.

```python
x = {}
for i in data['items']:
    x[i] = solver.IntVar(0, 1, 'x_%i' % (i))
```

#### 4. Setting the constraints

There are only 2 constraints for this problem:

1. Each item category must be in the backpack. This means that at least 1 every 3 items in the `items` array must have `x[i] = 1`:

```python
c = data['items_per_category']
for i in range(int(len(data['items']) / c)):
    solver.Add(sum(x[j] for j in range(i*c, i*c+c)) == 1)
```

2. the total weight must be under 25kg.

```python
solver.Add(sum(x[j] * data['weights'][j]
                for j in data['items']) <= data['capacity'])
```

#### 5. Optimization objective

The goal of the optimization is to maximize the survival points, as stated before.

```python
objective = solver.Objective()
for i in data['items']:
    objective.SetCoefficient(x[i], data['points'][i])
objective.SetMaximization()
```

#### 6. The solution

Now we have to execute the actual solution and print the results:

```python
status = solver.Solve()
if status == pywraplp.Solver.OPTIMAL:
    print("Total survival points: ", objective.Value())
    print("Items in the backpack:")
    total_weight = 0
    for i in data['items']:
        if x[i].solution_value() > 0:
            print("Item", i, " - weight: ",
                  data['weights'][i], " - points: ", data['points'][i])
            total_weight += data['weights'][i]
    print("Total weight: ", total_weight, "kg")
```

#### 7. Final numbers

By executing the script as explained above, we get the following solution:

```text
Total survival points:  75.0
Items in the backpack:
Item 1 (medium food) - weight:  8  - points:  20
Item 4 (medium water) - weight:  5  - points:  20
Item 7 (medium shelter) - weight:  8  - points:  15
Item 11 (big defense) - weight:  3  - points:  20
Total weight:  24 kg
```
